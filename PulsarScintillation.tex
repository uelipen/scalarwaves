\begin{abstract}
We propose to use pulsar scintillation measurements to test predictions of alternative theories of gravity. Comparing to single-path pulsar timing measurements, the scintillation measurements can achieve a factor of $10^4 \sim 10^5 $ improvement in timing accuracy, due to the effect of multi-path interference. The self-noise from pulsar also does not affect the interference pattern, where the data acquisition timescale is $10^3$ seconds instead of years. Therefore it has unique advantages in measuring gravitational effect or other mechanisms (at mHz and above frequencies) on light propagation. We illustrate its application in constraining scalar gravitational-wave background and measuring gravitational-wave speed, in which cases the sensitivities are greatly improved with respect to previous limits. We expect much broader applications in testing gravity with existing and future pulsar scintillation observations.

\noindent{\bf Introduction} -- Pulsar scintillation happens when pulsed radio signals from pulsars reach earth follow different paths of propagation and interfere with each others. It is generally believed that, turbulent interstellar plasma residing on the propagation path plays the role of an effective ``lens", generates necessary diffraction and scattering for the multi-path interfernce pattern. For an earth observer, such interference pattern contains many fringes within the timescale of a single pulse, which can be statistically averaged out to achieve pico-second order timing resolution. 
This unpresendetned timing precession allows the applications of scintillations in probing the physics of turbulent plasma in the interstellar medium [] and constraining the size of emission regions in the pulsar magnetospheres []. In this Letter, we propose to use pulsar scintilattions measurements to test predictions of alternative theories of gravity, in particular, the ones related to gravitatinal waves (GWs). Similar analysis can be applied to test other effects that affect the propagation of radio waves.

\noindent {\bf Scintillation Noise} -- {\bf Ue-Li: I will daft this section, please make your corrections and edits.} The scintillation of pulsars contain several noise components. The first noise piece comes from the emission source, which is usually referred as the {\it self noise} []. Such noise is generated by the stochastic processes in the emission sources, and its contamination to the visibility coulld be reduced by applying statisical averaging []. Secondly, there are additional complications due to intrinsic variations in the intensity of pulses, the finite size effect of the emission domain and the decoherence due to turbulent plasma motions.

The scintillation pattern has a typical decoehrence bandwidth $\Delta \nu_{\rm d} \propto \lambda^{-4}$ and  timescale $\Delta t_{\rm d} \sim s_0/V \propto \lambda^{-1}$, where $s_0$ is the spatial correlation length, $V$ is the earth velocity and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the radio wave. The observational bandwidth $B$ is assumed to be much larger than $\Delta \nu_{\rm d}$, and the data is averaged within a group of $N$ adjacent pulses. If we want to probe physics at frequency $f$, it is necassary to have $N t_0 \le f^{-1} \le \Delta t_{\rm d}$, where $t_0$ is the period for pulsar duty cycles.   Therefore at higher frequencies the number of available pulses in each averaging group is smaller, and the total number of pulses (for a typical milli-second pulsar) within the scintillation timescale is of order $10^6$. After the statisitical averaging [], the signal-to-noise ratio ${\rm SN}$ improves by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$.

The frequency-dependent timing accuracy is related to the bandwidth and the signal to noise ratio. {\bf Please add the reasoning}. Based on the above reasoning we have the following simplified model for the timing noise
\begin{align}\label{eqt}
\delta t_{\rm f} =  \left\{
\begin{array}{c}
1 ps \times \left ( \frac{\delta t_{\rm mHz}}{1 ps} \right ) \times \left (\frac{f}{ 10^{-3 } Hz} \right )^{1/2}\,,   \qquad f\ge1/\Delta t_{\rm d}\, \\
\\
\infty\,, \qquad \qquad f < \Delta t_d \,.
\end{array}\right.
\end{align}
where $\delta t_{\rm mHz}$ is the timing accuracy at $mHz$. In realitity there is still some residual sensitivity for $f<1/\Delta t_{\rm d}$, but we ignore this regime for simplicity. For Vela Pulsar $\delta t_{\rm mHz}$ is about.

Here $L_1 = r L$ and $L_2 = (1-r)L$. When the radio waves reach earth observer from these two directions, they interfere and produce very fine interference pattern based on the radio wavelength $\lambda$ and the path openning angle $r \alpha $. As earth moves at a speed $V_e \sim 30 km/s$, there are many fringes within the timescale of a single pulse.  }

\noindent {\bf Probing nontensorial components of GWs} -- Gravitational waves only have two tensor polarizations according to the theory of General Relatvity. However, gravitaional wave emissions with scalar and vector polarizations are predicted in many alternative theories of gravity, such as Scalar-Tensor Theory, $f(R)$ theory, bimetric theory, etc. A nice summary about GW polarization prediction in various alternative gravity models can be found in []. 

It is then physically interesting to measure and/or constrain GWs with non-tensor polarizations, in order to test the theories of gravity and serach for possible new physics. At ten to several hundred Hz, i.e., LIGO frequency band, it has been suggested [] to use a joint measurement of serval ground-based GW detectors to separate the mixture of different polarization modes. Below 1 Hz the current best constraint on nontensorial gravitational wave background (GWB) is given by acceleration measurements of sattelites, with constraint of deimensionless GW amplitude (tensorial or nontensorial mode) on the order of $10^{-15}$. At even lower frequency (nano Hz and above) the only only available constraints come from Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) measurements and anisotropy measurements of Cosmic Microwave Background. Here as an illustration for applications of Pulsar scintillation observations, we show that the existing data already provides the best constraint on scalar GWB at mHz band, which will be comparable to the sensitivity of future space-based GW missions such as eLISA. In order to obtain the sensitivity curve, we will show how to derive the transfer functions in such systems, while similar analysis should be applicable for other tests of gravity using pulsar scintillations.

As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:pulsarpath}, we consider a radio wave emitted from Pulsar ("P") propagates along two different patha ($\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{C}'$) and eventually reaches earth. For simplicity, we only consider an one-time deflection by the turbulent plasma at location "D", and we assume both paths are on the $x-z$ plane, with $\mathcal{C}$ being along $x$ axis. The coordinate of "P","D",and "O" on the $x-z$ plane is $[0,0],[L r/(1+r), L r \alpha/(1+r)], [L, 0]$ respectively.

Based on the standard pulsar timing analysis, the GW-induced (frequency $\omega$) \footnote{For simplicity hereafter we adopt the geometric unit that the speed of light $c=1$.} phase shift of radio waves (with wavelegnth $\lambda$) propagating along $\mathcal{C}$  is
\begin{align}\label{eqc}
H_C = \frac{n^i h_{ij} n^j}{2\omega \lambda} \frac{\sin [\omega L \xi+\psi]-\sin \psi}{\xi}\,, 
\end{align}
where $\psi$ is the initial phase of that particular GW, $\xi \equiv 1-{\bf k}\cdot {\bf n}$, with ${\bf k}$ being the direction vector of the GW and ${\bf n}={\bf e}_x$ being the direction vector of $P\rightarrow O$. The metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$ has $10$ components, $4$ of which are purely gauge. We can exploit the gauge freedom to let $h_{0\mu}=0$ and there are $6$ degrees of freedom left in $h_{ij}$ ($1 \le i,j \le 3$). We follow the convention in [] to denote these $6$ polarizations ($2$ tensor modes: $+,\times$, $2$ vector modes: $x,y$ and $2$ scalar modes: $b, l$). The tensor basis for a GW propagating along $z$-axis is
\begin{align}
&\tilde{e}^+
= 
\left (
\begin{array}{c c c}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}
\right ),\quad
\tilde{e}^\times
=\left (
\begin{array}{c c c}
0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}
\right )\,, \nonumber \\
&\tilde{e}^b
= 
\left (
\begin{array}{c c c}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}
\right ),\quad
\tilde{e}^l
=\left (
\begin{array}{c c c}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}
\right )\,, \nonumber \\
&\tilde{e}^x
= 
\left (
\begin{array}{c c c}
0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0
\end{array}
\right ),\quad
\tilde{e}^y
=\left (
\begin{array}{c c c}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0
\end{array}
\right )\,, 
\end{align}
so that $h_{ij}$ can be decomposed as 
\begin{align}
h_{ij} = \sum_{m} h_m \tilde{e}^m_{ij}\,.
\end{align}  
Follow the same principal the phase shift contribution of the same GW to radio waves propagating along $\mathcal{C}'$ is
\begin{align}\label{eqcp}
H_{\mathcal{C}'}= &\frac{n_1^i h_{ij} n_1^j}{2\omega \lambda} \frac{\sin [\omega r L \xi_1+\psi]-\sin \psi}{\xi_1}\nonumber\\
&+\frac{n_2^i h_{ij} n_2^j}{2\omega \lambda} \frac{\sin [\omega L \xi+\psi]-\sin [\omega r L \xi_1+\psi]}{\xi_2}\,,
\end{align}
where ${\bf n}_1={\bf e}_x+\alpha {\bf e}_z$, ${\bf n}_2 ={\bf e}_x-r \alpha  {\bf e}_z$ and $\xi_{1,2}=1-{\bf n}_{1,2} \cdot {\bf k}$. With $H_{\mathcal{C}}$ and $H_{\mathcal{C}'}$, we can derive the sky (direction of the GW) and initial averaged phase shit
\begin{align}
\delta \Phi^2 &\equiv \langle (H_{\mathcal{C}}-H_{\mathcal{C}'})^2\rangle \nonumber \\
&\propto  \frac{h^2_m \alpha^2}{\omega^2 \lambda^2} \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
 \log(\omega L)\,, & m=+, \times\, b, \\
\\
 \omega L\,, & m =x, y\,, \\
\\
\omega^2L^2\,, & m=l\,,
\end{array}\right.
\label{bx}
\end{align}
assuming $\omega L \gg 1$. In partular, we find that the longitudinal mode (``$l$") receives the largest amplification factor ($\propto \omega^2 L^2$), and its detailed transfer function is given by
\begin{align}
\delta \Phi =\frac{h_l \alpha L}{\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{r}{8(1+r)}} \sqrt{ \log (1+r)+r\log \frac{1+r}{r}}.
\end{align}
Combinging with the timing noise estimate given in the previous section, we can obtain the sensitivity of Pulsar scintillation measurement on longitudinal scalar GWs, by making $\delta \Phi =c\, \delta t_{\rm f}/\lambda$. Take $r \sim 1$, this gives the sensitivity on $h_l$ (dimensionless GW amplitude) as
\begin{align}
h_l = 6.8\times 10^{-18}  \frac{\delta t_{\rm mHz}}{1 ps}   \left (\frac{f}{ m Hz} \right )^{1/2} \left (\frac{\alpha}{{\rm arcsec}} \right )^{-1} \left ( \frac{L}{k {\rm pc}}\right)^{-1}\,.
\end{align}

\end{figure}


In Fig.~\ref{fig:sensitivity}, we compare the sensitivity of longitudinal scalar GWs based on scnitillation measurements of Vila Pulsar, and the current best constraint based on sattellite timing. This single pulsar scinetillation measurement already improves the previous sensitivity by a factor of $10^2 \sim 10^3$.  By choosing more distant pulsars and/or the ones with better scintillation timing accuracy, as well as stastitically averaging data for different scintillating pulsars,  it is possible to further improve this limit. For illustration, we also present the sensitivity of eLISA at the same frequency band.
\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent{\bf Measuring the GW speed} -- As a second application, we discuss using Pulsar scintillations to measure possible diffrence between GW speed (both $+,\times$ modes) and light speed. As non-tensorial GW polarizations, nonzero deviation from light propagation speed for GWs is also predicted by many modified gravity models (such as Scalar Tensor Theory). We will avoid discussing different possible origins of this deviation, but instead derive its frequency dependent constraint based on scintillation data.

The basic idea is similar to previous work on measuring GW speed, which was based on  Pulsar Timing data and gave constraint at $n Hz$ band []. We make the assumption that there is a stochastic GWB (of tensorial waves). At the $mHz$ band, the dominant sources for GWB is extragalactic massive black hole binaries [], which contributes gavitational-wave strain 
\begin{align}\label{eqhc}
h_c(f) \sim 10^{-18} \left ( \frac{f}{m Hz}\right )^{-2/3}\,.
\end{align}

If GW speed is less than the light speed $\epsilon \equiv 1-v_{\rm gw}/c > 0$, the part of GWs with ${\bf n}\cdot {\bf k} \approx 1-\epsilon$ will have similar projected speed of the radio waves, and consequenctly their propagation phases are approximately synronized. The polarization of these GWs are not completely orthogonal to the direction of radio waves, so that these GWs still shift the phase of the radio waves. For single-path Pulsar timing observation, this resonance effect (also known as ``surfing effect" []) leads to the square phase shift (averaging over the sky directions)
\begin{align}
\delta \Phi^2_s \sim \frac{\pi \epsilon^2 L h_c^2}{2 \omega \lambda^2}\,,
\end{align} 
assuming $\epsilon^2 \omega L \gg 1$. For double-path scintillation scenario, we notice that the phase shift along $\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{C}'$ can be obtained by replacing $\xi = 1-\epsilon-{\bf n}\cdot {\bf k}$ in Eq.~\ref{eqc} and Eq.~\ref{eqcp}. After applying the sky and initial phase average, we can obtain the following transfer function  
\begin{align}\label{eqphid}
\delta \Phi^2_d \sim \frac{\pi r^2}{4(1+r)^2} \frac{h_c^2\alpha^2 \epsilon^3 (\omega L)^3}{\omega^2 \lambda^2}\,,
\end{align}
in the limit of $\epsilon \omega L \gg 1$. As we are comparing phase between two colse paths $\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{C}'$, the surfing effect is enhanced iwith the presence of additional $\omega L$. At the same frequency, $\delta \Phi_d/\delta \Phi_s \sim \alpha \omega L\sqrt{\epsilon} \gg 1$ for typical pulsars at $m$Hz band and with $\epsilon \sim 3.7 \times 10^{-3}$ bound given in [] (obtained at $n$Hz range). Taking into account the fact of better timing accuracy with pulsar scintillations measurements, it is certainly always better to measure $\epsilon(f)$ at $m$Hz or higher frequencies. In fact, combining Eq.~\ref{eqphid}, Eq.~\ref{eqhc} and Eq.~\ref{eqt}, we arrive at the following upper limit on $\epsilon$ (take $r \sim 1$): 
\begin{align}
\epsilon(f) \le& 1.8\times 10^{-4} \nonumber\\ 
&\times \left ( \frac{\delta t_{\rm mHz}}{1 ps}\right )  \left (\frac{f}{ m Hz} \right )^{2/3} \left (\frac{\alpha}{{\rm arcsec}} \right )^{-1} \left ( \frac{L}{k {\rm pc}}\right)^{-3/2}
\end{align}
which gives a first constraint on GW speed at $10^{-3}$Hz - $1$Hz frequency band. We note that for certain models that give rise to nonzero $\epsilon$, e.g. the ones with constant nonzero graviton mass $m_g$, it is much more convenient to use low-frequency tests, as $\epsilon(\omega) \sim m^2_g/\omega^2$. However, in order to obtain model-indepdent constraints, we need to measure $\epsilon(f)$ at different frequencies.

\noindent{\bf Discussion}--  Comparing to single path pulsar timing measurements, the scintillation measurements have better timing accuracies, and the phase-comparison geometry which naturally removes intrinsic noise from the source. These are the key factors which ensures its ultra presicion and enables its application in studying ISM physics, pulsar physics and our proposal in this Letter - testing alternative gravity models.

We have illustrated two examples in this proposal: measuring longitudinal scalar GW and the speed of GWs. It is also possible to apply for other tests which do not involve GWs - for example, 
the holographic noise [] or the spacetime quantum fluctuations [] would contribute distinctive phase noise for photon traveling along different scintillation paths, and hence can be measured by observing analomous scintillation phase shift or degrading of the interference pattern.
